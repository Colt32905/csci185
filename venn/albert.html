        <h2>I. Early life and education</h2>
        <p>Einstein was born in Germany in 1879 to Jewish parents. He showed a talent for math and physics from an early age. He studied at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School and received his diploma in 1900. He obtained his PhD in 1905 from the University of Zurich.</p>

    <h3>II. Einstein's Religious Beliefs</h3>
        <p>Einstein was not a follower of any organized religion, but he had a deep sense of awe and wonder at the beauty and harmony of the natural world. He believed in a pantheistic God who reveals himself in the laws of physics, not in a personal God who intervenes in human affairs. He admired the ethical teachings of Judaism and Christianity, but he rejected their dogmas and rituals. He considered himself an agnostic and a religious nonbeliever.</p>

    <h4>III. Einstein's Scientific Discoveries</h4>
        <p>Einstein made groundbreaking contributions to physics, especially in the fields of relativity and quantum mechanics. He developed the special and general theories of relativity, which describe the nature of space, time, gravity, and energy. He also explained the photoelectric effect, which shows how light behaves as both a wave and a particle. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for this discovery. He also proposed the concept of mass-energy equivalence, expressed by the famous equation E = mc2.</p>

        <h5>IV. Social and political views </h5>
            <p>Einstein was a pacifist and a humanist who advocated for social justice and world peace. He was a supporter of the civil rights movement and a critic of racism and militarism. He was also a vocal opponent of nuclear weapons and warned of their dangers. He was a citizen of several countries, including Germany, Switzerland, and the United States. He renounced his German citizenship in 1933 after the rise of the Nazis, who persecuted him for his Jewish heritage and his scientific ideas. He settled in Princeton, New Jersey, where he worked at the Institute for Advanced Study until his death in 1955. We felt this was important as it mentioned his Jewish heritage.</p>
