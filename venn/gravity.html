    <h3>II. Newton's Religious Beliefs</h3>
    <p>Newton was a devout but heterodox Christian who rejected the doctrine of the Trinity and believed in a monotheistic God as the masterful creator of the universe. He studied the Bible extensively and wrote many religious tracts that dealt with prophecy, chronology and the origins of Christianity. He was influenced by Socinian and Arian views and kept his heretical beliefs private. <a href="#link2">[2]</a><a href="#link3">[3]</a></p>
