    <p>My name is Gabe McGraw and I am a student at Isothermal Community College currently studying to be an electrician. I have always felt a sense of pride when I would finish cleaning my truck, both inside and out; especially when I'm riding around in it and everyone can see that newly-waxed shine. This has led me to start McGraw's Suds N Shine: a mobile detailing business so that others can drive around feeling proud of the vehicle that they are riding in.</p>
