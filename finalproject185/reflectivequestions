1.What did you accomplish this week (i.e. how'd it go)?

This week I was able to get a circle to move using the arrow keys and I was able to get cars to drive across the screen. I was also 
able to change the color of the circle if it touched a car which is a step towards the "game over" portion of the game

2. What took the most time / was the most challenging part of what you did? Do you feel stuck? How can you get unstuck? 
Is there any specific feedback that you would like from Sarah?

The hardest part of the whole thing was finding the small issues in the code that should work but decides not to. Yes I felt stuck
because most of the time I do not understand javascript and how it works I just know that when I do something,
 60% of the time it works every time

3. What will you turn in for your final deliverable. Please describe what you plan to accomplish.

I want a game like crossy road where you are an avatar and you must dodge cars and such to get across the screen without being hit
or possibly falling in water. You can also collect coins as you go that I might add into a sort of shop where you can purchase new 
avatars or something. you get hit by a car or fall in the water and it is game over and you start from the beginning.

4.Given your experience this week, are you on track to deliver on what you proposed last week? If not, what adjustments 
to the scope of your project are you planning to make?

My whole project changed so I am starting from scratch as far as scope is concerned but honestly since most of this is javascript
it will take every bit of time I am allowed because it is confusing to me. I just wanted to make a game because I like games
