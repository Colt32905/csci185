Please answer the following accessibility questions:


1. What accessibility corrections did you have to make?

I had to make alt tags for all of the images and define the language in the html (english). there are still 10 "errors" but it is 
just the buttons that make the website tabbable.


2. Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the CSS? Why or why not?

Usable, yes. user friendly and nicely set up so that the person viewing 
it is not mad about the whole thing and is generally pleased with the layout? No. It has all of the things together
that should be together but it is not pleasing to the eye or to anyone looking at using it due to it being gigantic images and small 
text.

3. Is your site is tabbable? In other words, without the use of the mouse, are all the links and buttons accessible using the tab key?

Yes it is because of the buttons with no value, so that there is something for the tab key to physically select
